# input_quality/

This repo contains the data, code, scripts, and written work for the manuscript "Comparing Language Input in Homes of Blind and Sighted Children: Insights from Daylong Recordings".

## Files

- `data`: folder containing both raw and derived data for the project
- `english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe`: udpipe object, created in `input_quality_preprocessing.R`. I would like to move this somewhere else, but it keeps regenerating here
- `manuscript`: folder containing files related to the manuscript resulting from this project (e.g., code for all preprocessing and analyses in the manuscript, references, figures, source and compiled code for the manuscript itself)
- `MPAL_BUCLD_presentations`: contains figures and slides from EC's October 2023 MPAL presentation and November 2023 BUCLD presentation. 
- production_analyses: contains brief summaries of analysis looking at possible relationships between input and production. EC wants to ditch since we don't have enough data to look at individual differences (yet!)
