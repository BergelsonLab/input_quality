# input_quality/production_analyses

This folder contains two Rmds with exploratory analyses of the relationship between language input and child production in this dataset. Why two? Because EC forgot that she had already made one.

## Files

- `input_to_production.Rmd/html`: looks at the relationship between all 8 input variables and production (measured in 3 ways: CVC, AVA, and CDI). This version only contains graphs, with zero-order correlation coefficients by group. Rmd contains code, html is rendered file.
- `supplementals.Rmd/pdf`: looks at the relationship between a subset of the input variables (excludes CTC and manual token count due to collinearity with other variables) and CVC. This version looks at fewer variables, but analyzes data both as a linear model and with zero-order correlations. This version is a little more polished and contains text explanations. Rmd contains code, pdf is rendered file.
